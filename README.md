Book Club Favorites is a Sinatra CRUD application. It allows users to create an account, sign in, and sign out. 
Once the user is signed in, the user can browse the available books and favorite lists. The user can create their own favorite list and add their favorite books and associate it with the genre it relates to. Users can edit and delete their own list as well. 

This application was developed as a portfolia project for Flatiron School- Online Software Engineering Program.
